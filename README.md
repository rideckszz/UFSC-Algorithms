This repository contains activities developed during programming classes at the Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina, covering both Python programming and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Java.

## Repository Structure

- **Semestre 1 - Python:** This directory contains activities developed using the Python programming language. Each folder within this directory corresponds to a specific activity, containing the source code and, when applicable, instructions or prompts.
- **Java:** Here are the activities developed using Java, focusing on Object-Oriented Programming. Similar to the Python section, each folder within this directory represents a distinct activity and contains the source code and relevant information.
- **Estruturas/Recursividade:** Here are the activities related to Data Structures using Java.
  
## Navigating the Repository

To access a specific activity, simply navigate to the directory corresponding to the language and technology used. Within each directory, you will find the source code and any other necessary files to understand and execute the activity.
